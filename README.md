# Open Module Folder

**Open Module Folder** is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to quickly reveal the folder of any npm module listed in your `package.json` file. Simply click on a module name in the `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, or `peerDependencies` section, and the corresponding folder in `node_modules` will be revealed in the Explorer panel â€” automatically expanded for easy access.
